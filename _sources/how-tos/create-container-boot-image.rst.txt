Create Container Boot Image
---------------------------

This page provides instructions for creating a bootable Linux kernel image in container format and setup boot partition in |SPN| to boot from it.

.. note:: See :ref:`gen-container-tool` for more details on container format.

The following step-by-step instructions is an example to boot Yocto kernel using container image format on |UP2|.

.. important:: SBL Linux boot image containers typically include the kernel, kernel params and initramfs. The kernel then will mount the root file system from the boot media. There may be additional requirements in terms of configuration and layout for the kernel to locate and mount the root file system. If your boot image has some partition layout requirements, file/file-path dependencies, etc., you still need to adhere to those requirements when using container boot.

**Step 1:** Download |CNT|, |SS| and |CMU| to the same working directory to use the container tool.

**Step 2:** Get kernel and associated files from target Yocto disk image.

 1. Locate and save a copy of vmlinuz (e.g. ``vmlinuz``), initramfs (``initrd``)

 2. Create ``cmdline.txt`` with kernel command line string. There are different ways to extract kernel command line from a booted system. Examples includes ``grub.cfg``, ``/proc/cmdline`` or via ``dmesg | grep 'Command line'``. If the command line is empty, create an empty file.

**Step 3:** Generate ``container.bin`` file

Run::

  GenContainer.py create -cl CMDL:<cmdline.txt> KRNL:<vmlinuz> INRD:<initrd> -k <RSA_private_key> -t CLASSIC -o container.bin

     <RSA_private_key>: RSA 2048/3072 private key path in PEM format to sign image.
                        Ex: OS1_TestKey_Priv_RSA2048.pem/OS1_TestKey_Priv_RSA3072.pem available in SblKeys directory. Alternatively it can be generated from GenerateKeys.py
     <RSA_private_key>: Hash of the public key should be included in SBL Key Manifest and HASH_USAGE should be set to 'PUBKEY_OS' during SBL build.
                        SBL Key hash manifest is configured in GetKeyHashList in platform BoarConfig.py. Default hash included is for OS1_TestKey_Priv_RSA2048.pem/OS1_TestKey_Priv_RSA3072.pem.

Sample output messages::


    Container 'BOOT' was created successfully at:
    /home/user/container.bin


**Step 4:** Copy ``container.bin`` onto the first boot partition on |UP2|.

Depending whether you are booting from eMMC or USB, ``container.bin`` should be copied to the **root** directory on the boot device.

**Step 5:** Configure boot option entry to load ``container.bin`` from the boot partition

Make sure the boot option is configured to the location of ``container.bin`` on the boot device. E.g., if ``container.bin`` is located on the first boot FAT32 partition on USB, the boot option entry should look like the following::

    - !expand { BOOT_OPTION_TMPL : [ 3 ,   0    ,  0 ,    5   ,   0   ,    0  ,     0 ,     0 , 'container.bin' ] }

See :ref:`change-boot-options` for more details.


**Step 6:** Build, stitch, flash and boot

Follow :ref:`supported-hardware` to build a flashable image for the target platform.

.. note:: If the target boot option is not the first entry, enter |SPN| shell first to switch it to the first one.

Example boot messages::

    ...
    <Switch boot option to boot USB ...>
    ...

    Shell> exit

      2|      0|   MMC |    0 |   0 |    0 | EXT2 |    1 | container.bin
      3|      0|  NVME |    0 |   0 |    0 | EXT2 |    1 | container.bin
