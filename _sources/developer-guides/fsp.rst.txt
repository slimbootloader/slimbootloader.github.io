Firmware Support Package
---------------------------

Intel® Firmware Support Package (Intel® FSP) provides key programming information for initializing Intel® silicon and can be easily integrated into a boot loader of the developer’s choice. In essence, |SPN| is a minimal boot loader that consumes
FSP as a binary package. FSP is widely used in many open source or commercial boot solutions on newer Intel silicons.

|SPN| supports |FSP Specification v2.0|

FSP provides many configuration options called User Product Data (UPD). See FSP UPD header files (``Silicon/<platform_foo>/Include/Fsp*Upd.h``).

FSP UPD is exposed to |SPN| configuration data interface so FSP can be configured directly using |CFGTOOL| or at |SPN| runtime.

.. note:: 

  |SPN| includes FSP interfacing infrastructure including locating and loading FSP binary, configuring FSP UPDs and calling FSP APIs. 

  This infrastructure is implemented in |SPN| core code to allow ease of porting to a new silicon.
